KCAPTCHA Version 2.0 - A Port for CodeIgniter
=============================================

Installation
------------

Download this package and uncompress it within `application/` directory of your CodeIgniter site.
Then activate Session library/driver. GD image processing PHP module should be installed.

This feature has been tested on CodeIgniter 3.1.11 (September 19th, 2019).

A Quick Test
------------

Open with browser the following URL:

http://localhost/site/index.php/captcha_test

or

http://localhost/site/captcha_test (if you removed the URL-segment index.php).

Usage
-----

Examine code of the controller Captcha_test.php and the views captcha_test.php and captcha_test_ok.php.
This would be enough for you to get the idea how captcha feature works.
