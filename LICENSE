KCAPTCHA is a free software. You can freely use it for developing own site or software.
If you use this software as a part of own sofware, you must leave copyright notices intact or add KCAPTCHA copyright notices to own.
As a default configuration, KCAPTCHA has a small credits text at bottom of CAPTCHA image.
You can remove it, but I would be pleased if you left it. ;)
